"This project will not include upgrading old systems or on-premises infrastructure. It will focus only on Azure integration, excluding custom application development, advanced data processing, or support for tools outside the agreed scope."


"The system architecture outlines how different components, like applications, databases, and services, are connected. It describes how data flows between on-premises systems and Azure, using tools like Azure Logic Apps, Functions, and APIs to ensure seamless integration and scalability."

"API endpoints are specific URLs where the system sends or receives data. They define how different systems communicate, including the request formats, responses, and any required authentication for secure integration between services."

"The data model defines how information is structured and stored in the system. It includes the organization of data into tables, fields, and relationships, ensuring consistency and easy access for integration and processing."

"This defines the expected result when the operation is successfully completed. It includes details like response messages, data returned by the system, or confirmation of the completed action, ensuring the process met its goal."

"This defines what happens when the operation fails. It includes error messages, codes, or logs that explain the issue, helping users or systems understand and resolve the problem."

"This provides a list of possible errors that might occur during the process. Each error includes a code, message, and description to help identify the issue and guide troubleshooting."



"The versioning strategy outlines how different versions of the system or API will be managed. It specifies how updates or changes are tracked, typically through version numbers (like v1, v2) to ensure compatibility. This helps users understand which version they are using and ensures that existing features remain stable when new ones are added. It also defines how backward compatibility will be maintained and when deprecated versions will be phased out."

"The security and compliance strategy ensures that the system meets industry standards and protects data from unauthorized access. It outlines measures like encryption, user authentication, and regular security audits. The design also follows legal and regulatory requirements, ensuring that data privacy and protection laws are adhered to. This strategy helps maintain a secure environment while ensuring the system remains compliant with relevant regulations."

"This section outlines how the system connects with external services or platforms (third-party integrations). It includes the APIs, protocols, and data exchange formats used to communicate with these systems. It also details any authentication methods, error handling, and how data consistency is maintained across platforms. This ensures smooth integration while managing dependencies and external service availability."

"The stack refers to the combination of technologies and tools used to build and run the system. It includes programming languages, frameworks, databases, cloud services, and any other software components. This section outlines how these technologies work together to support the systemâ€™s functionality, scalability, and performance. It ensures that the chosen stack meets the project requirements and supports long-term maintainability."


"The deployment process outlines how the system will be released and updated in the production environment. It includes steps like code compilation, testing, and transferring files to servers. This section also covers how configurations are managed, environments are set up, and monitoring is implemented to ensure smooth and reliable deployments. It ensures that new versions are deployed safely with minimal downtime and issues."

"Scalability ensures that the system can handle increased workloads by adding resources when needed. This section outlines how the architecture supports growth, such as using cloud services that allow automatic scaling or load balancing. It also considers designing the system to handle higher traffic or more data without sacrificing performance. The goal is to ensure the system can grow smoothly as demands increase over time."

"Disaster recovery outlines the plan to restore the system in case of failures or unexpected events, ensuring minimal downtime and data loss. It includes backup strategies, data replication, and failover mechanisms to switch to a backup system quickly. This section also describes how critical components are protected and how recovery tests are conducted to ensure the system can recover efficiently when needed."


"Testing ensures the system works as expected by checking all features and functionalities. Test cases are created for different scenarios, outlining the steps to test each feature, expected results, and how to handle errors. This section covers unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing to verify the system's performance, security, and usability. It ensures that any issues are identified and resolved before deployment."

"CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) automates the process of integrating code changes and deploying them to production. It ensures that every update is tested and deployed quickly and consistently. This section outlines the tools and workflows used for automating build, test, and release processes. It also describes how the system ensures that new versions are released smoothly with minimal downtime and bugs."

"API monitoring tracks the performance and health of APIs to ensure they are functioning correctly. This includes checking for errors, response times, and uptime. Monitoring tools alert the team about any issues, like slow responses or failures, allowing for quick resolution. This ensures that the APIs remain reliable and available for users, minimizing downtime and disruptions."


"Logging records important events, errors, and system activities for troubleshooting and analysis. It helps track user actions, system behavior, and any issues that occur. Logs are stored securely and can be reviewed to diagnose problems or improve system performance. This ensures that any unexpected behavior can be identified and addressed quickly."
